# Crop Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is focused on predicting crop yields using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to help farmers, agricultural researchers, and policymakers make more informed decisions regarding crop selection, planning and harvesting. By leveraging historical data, environmental factors, and crop-specific features, the model provides predictions for crop productivity. This model employes various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest to predict the crop outcomes with high accuracies.

## Data
The model was trained using data from the Crop Prediction dataset, which includes agricultural information such as crop types, weather conditions, soil characteristics, and other relevant features.

## Model & Training
The model is trained using Supervised Learning Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest.
Logistic regression model accuracy: 97.045%
Decision tree model accuracy: 99.318%
